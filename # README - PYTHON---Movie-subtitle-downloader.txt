Sure! Here's a simple Python script that uses the pysub-downloader library to download subtitles for a movie. This script will allow you to input the name of the movie, and it will download the appropriate subtitle for you. 🎬📥

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pysub-downloader
Step 2: Create the Python Script
Now, you can create the Python script. Here's a simple example:

python
Copy code
import pysubdownloader as psd

def download_subtitle(movie_name):
    try:
        # Create a subtitle downloader object
        downloader = psd.SubtitleDownloader()
        
        # Search and download the subtitle
        subtitles = downloader.search_subtitles(movie_name)
        if subtitles:
            subtitle = subtitles[0]
            downloader.download_subtitle(subtitle)
            print(f"Subtitle downloaded successfully for: {movie_name} 🎉")
        else:
            print(f"No subtitles found for: {movie_name} 😞")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e} 🚨")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    movie_name = input("Enter the name of the movie: ")
    download_subtitle(movie_name)
Step 3: Run the Script
To run the script, simply execute the Python file:

bash
Copy code
python download_subtitle.py
When prompted, enter the name of the movie for which you want to download subtitles, and the script will handle the rest! 🎥

Key Points:
Subtitle Search: The script searches for the most relevant subtitles available online.
Automatic Download: It automatically downloads the first result, which is usually the most accurate one.
Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling to manage potential issues, such as network errors or no subtitles being found.
This basic implementation should get you started with downloading subtitles. You can expand the functionality, like offering a choice of subtitles or downloading subtitles in different languages. 🌍📺

Enjoy your movie with the perfect subtitles! 🍿🎬
